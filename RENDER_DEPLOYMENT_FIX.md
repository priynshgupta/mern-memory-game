# Render Deployment Fix

## Problem Summary

The deployment to Render was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/server.js'
```

This was because Render was looking for the server.js file in the root directory, but the actual server code is in the `/server` subdirectory.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Created a Wrapper File**: Added a `server.js` file to the root directory that redirects to the actual server in the `server` subdirectory.

2. **Updated Package.json**: Added a `render-start` script to the root package.json to properly start the server.

3. **Updated render.yaml Configurations**:
   - In root directory: Changed the build command to install dependencies in both root and server directories
   - In server directory: Added `rootDir: .` to specify the correct directory context

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit and Push the Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render deployment with server.js wrapper and updated config"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for Automatic Deployment**: If you've set up automatic deployments in Render, the changes will be deployed automatically.

3. **Manual Redeployment**: If necessary, you can manually trigger a redeployment from the Render dashboard.

## Verification

After the deployment completes, check the Render logs for:
- Successful build output
- The message "Starting server from root directory wrapper..."
- No "module not found" errors

## Additional Notes

- This solution allows Render to find and run your server code correctly.
- The solution maintains the separation between your server and client code.
- If you make changes to the server directory structure in the future, make sure to update the wrapper file accordingly.

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues with this deployment solution, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in the Render dashboard
3. Ensure MongoDB connection is properly configured and accessible from Render
