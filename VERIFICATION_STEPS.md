# Verification Steps for MERN Memory Game Deployment

## Backend Verification

1. Check if the backend is running properly:
   ```bash
   curl https://dhyaan-chakra-api.onrender.com/api/health
   ```
   Expected response: `{"status":"ok","message":"API is running"}`

2. Test user authentication:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://dhyaan-chakra-api.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
   ```

3. Test leaderboard fetch:
   ```bash
   curl https://dhyaan-chakra-api.onrender.com/api/scores/leaderboard
   ```

## Frontend Verification

1. Verify build succeeded on Vercel
2. Visit the deployed frontend URL and check if the app loads properly
3. Test user registration and login
4. Test game functionality
5. Verify leaderboard display
6. Check user statistics

## Common Issues Fixed

1. Fixed missing axios import in GameContext.js
2. Removed API_URL from dependency array in useCallback in GameContext.js
3. Fixed code formatting in AuthContext.js
4. Updated axiosConfig.js with consistent authorization headers
5. Added proper error handling for network failures

## Post-Deployment Checks

- Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices
- Verify that score submission works correctly
- Confirm authentication persists across page reloads
- Test game level progression
